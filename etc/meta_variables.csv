line_3,"Line 3 and Line 1 (Social Organization of the Vocal Group) correspond, but the social relationships between the orchestra's parts are more difficult to identify - for example, it is often hard to distinguish between types of overlap. In many cases, two or more coding situations may be equally important, requiring multiple coding. The scale is one of increasing integration, from solo to interlock.",data,public,TRUE,Categorical,,,,"Required and public,"
line_4,The musical coordination amongst the singers in a group considers both melodic and rhythmic elements.,data,public,TRUE,Categorical,,,,"Required and public,"
line_5,"Both diffuse and cohesive sounds are pleasing within a given aesthetic. Much tonal blend depends upon wide, clear voicing and the relative absence of vocal noise and ornamentation. In contrast, with tonal independence, no individual yields to another, producing a noisy effect. Intermediate blend is often a reedy unison in which individual voices are heard.",data,public,TRUE,Ordinal,,,,"Required and public,"
line_6,"The degree of rhythmic coordination between members of the singing group depends on the degree to which its members coordinate their attacks and releases. Rhythmic blend is considered maximal when attacks and releases are precisely coordinated. If movement from note to note is staggered, then rhythmic blend is considered minimal. Both effects are aesthetically grounded, powerful, and pleasing.",data,public,TRUE,Categorical,,,,"Required and public,"
line_7,"Overall musical coordination amongst members of the orchestra, taking both melodic and rhythmic elements into account. Here, polyrhythm is treated as a type of polyphony, as each part is independent.",data,public,TRUE,Ordinal,,,,"Required and public,"
line_8,"The concept of tonal blend applies to orchestras differently than to voices. An orchestra composed of several different kinds of instruments can rarely achieve the same degree of tonal unity as a chorus of voices. Consequently, the measure of blend for orchestras is not uniformity of timbre, but rather the overall sonority of the ensemble.",data,public,TRUE,Ordinal,,,,"Required and public,"

Hence, the sequence of the four categories of melodic shape is arbitrary.",data,public,TRUE,Categorical,,,,"Required and public,"
line_16,"Line 16 is an attempt to deal succinctly with the full range of melodic forms. At one end of the scale is simple litany, defined here as a short tune composed of one or two phrases repeated over and over again; in the middle there are strophic forms; and at the other end is the most complex type, through-composed, in which many varied phrases are strung together in a fashion that to some listeners may seem to be almost formless. Degrees of melodic variation within these forms are dealt with here as well.",data,public,TRUE,Ordinal,,,,"Required and public,"
line_17,"A simple five-point scale is used to describe phrase length. Coding was done without a stopwatch for half the song sample, and then a test with a stopwatch was made.

line_22,"This measure considers the use of simultaneously produced intervals other than unison or the octave.

line_25,"Volume measures the relative degree of loudness in a performance. As with tempo, a subjective scale cued by the human ear proved most useful for determining volume.

line_34,"A nasalized tone is a strong marker of some singing styles even in the absence of nasal syllables, probably because singing is normally louder and more forceful than speaking. When a wide sample of recorded song is examined, the absence of nasalization in some styles is also striking. For this reason, nasalization is coded, in spite of the vagueness of the term.",data,public,TRUE,Ordinal,,,,"Required and public,"
line_35,"Rasp is frequently associated with very marked, forced vocalizing. It cuts through musical performances in which everyone is singing loudly with a loud accompaniment. In some parts of the world, performers sing in a grating tone, at the same time forcefully emphasizing consonants. The result is clear articulation, but with a noisier tonal image.",data,public,TRUE,Ordinal,,,,"Required and public,"
