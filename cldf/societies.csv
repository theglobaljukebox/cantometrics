Theirs is a single continuous territory which spans 300 kilometers.  Because their land is not broken up by other ethnic groups their cultural identity has remained strong and cohesive. Spiritual  beliefs and way of life varies little in the different regions of the territory. They represent one of the largest ethnic minorities in the Indochinese region. According to the 2019 census their population has reached 1.45 million.

Very little is known of their prehistory but it is believed that the area was originally inhabited by only one culture but dispersal and cultural isolation formed diverse ethnic identities. The Vietnamese originally referred to the Muong with the disparaging appellation of “Mi” or “Mois” which means “savages.”  The Muong referred to themselves as the “Mol” which means “people.” In recent decades they have been recognized as the Muong. They are part of the Mon-Khmer Group of Austroasiatic languages. 

Their habitat has been destroyed over time by deforestation and U.S. bombing during the Vietnam War. Today most Muong have moved from the mountains and live at the foot of small hills near streams and rivers. They live in small hamlets of typically 50 households. Their houses are raised on wood pilings to about 6 feet and follow a traditional plan having two rooms, a thatched roof and wooden floors. This is a patriarchal society and the homes reflect male power. Women live in the smaller room close to the kitchen, while the front room is for greeting guests and is a sacred space holding the ancestral altar. The center of the larger room is for men. There are many rules that apply to the home. The front room has windows but women are not allowed to sit near the windows. Only men and high status guests have that privilege. It is taboo for guests to cross their legs in front of the altar or to turn their back to it. Women must not brush their hair on the top landing of the stairs and hair must not be left on the floor but placed underneath the floor. 

Muong economy is agrarian. Wet rice, which is grown on terraced land, is their food staple. Women are the food gatherers, gathering tubers, fruits, vegetables, mushrooms.They also weed, husk rice and harvest. The men hunt and fish. It is the men’s job to do the plowing, clearing bushes, making farm tools as well as building houses. Animal husbandry includes pigs, poultry and buffaloes. From what remains of the forests, they gather wood, pharmaceutical plants, and cinnamon that they then trade in exchange for pottery, brass and iron. Muong handicrafts include weaving cotton and silk and making baskets. They are also known for their folksongs and antiphonal singing (a call and response style of singing). Musical instruments are gongs and wooden bucket with a pestle .

Traditionally Muong society was feudal, run by a headman who belonged to one of the four dominant clans. He had complete authority and was supported by the aristocracy.Together they controlled two thirds of the cultivated fields. The rest was left for the peasants to cultivate. The peasants in return were required to pay dues and to work the land of the aristocrats and headman. Peasants could barely survive under this system. All this changed with the revolution of 1945. The authority of the headman was abolished and the farms were now worked collectively and administered by a committee elected by the people’s council. These agricultural collectives adapted new technologies which increased productivity. They also branched out creating rural credit systems, establishing schools, hospitals, etc. In Muong society it is a customary practice to help and support each other. Anyone who refuses to help another is condemned by the whole community.  
        
Marriage for the Muong is exogamous, that is, they are  forbidden to marry within the lineage of a clan. Traditionally marriages were arranged by parents, sometimes before puberty. For the marriage ceremony, the groom’s family donates pork, alcohol and some silver coins. The bride’s family pays a bride price. Divorce is rare but is on the rise. Widows are encouraged to remarry. The Muong are monogamous although in the past aristocracy and headmen had multiple wives and concubines. Today marriage for love is increasing and arranged marriages and pre-puberty marriages are on the decline.

The traditional Muong religion is mainly animistic believing that the world is inhabited by spirits who have many functions, primarily to help or punish individuals. People pray to spirits to promote health for the family, farm animals, a good harvest, etc. There are three levels in the Muong cosmos. The middle tier represents the earth, The upper tier is where the King of Heaven resides and it is he who decides on the faith of each soul. The lower tier is under water where snakes live who can change their shape. Ancestor worship is very important to the Muong. When an individual dies the soul travels to the upper tier where the King of Heaven will decide its fate. The soul will also be with the ancestor spirits. Traditionally the body would be kept in the house for up to twelve days. An ox, buffalo or pig is sacrificed and feasted on by the relatives for several days. The animal is believed to serve the soul in the afterlife. The role of the shaman is to sing a song that will help the soul move on. The shaman also treats the sick by exorcising harmful spirits. Today  many of these beliefs are declining in practice.

To summarize such regional distinctions (urther complicated by local variations), complex polyphony arises in the Svaneti region in northwestern Georgia; three-part polyphony with yodel and hocketing in the Guria Region, remarkably like African hunter-gather style; two-part polyphony over a bass drone in Kakheti.
